# sf-muni-te
San Francisco MUNI tracker. This is a D3 + geoJSON implementation using SVG. I have often struggled with SVG implementations, so decided to go that route this time. It is slower than the canvas animation updates, but it has a nice set of functions that'll be useful elsewhere.

This site works best in Firefox, because it has the canonical SVG and SVG2 implementation now. Chrome seems to have trouble with transform/translation of SVG root element.
