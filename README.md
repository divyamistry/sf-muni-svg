# SF MUNI Tracker
The implementation is accessible via [Github Pages](https://divyamistry.github.com/sf-muni-svg).

This is a D3 + geoJSON implementation using SVG. I have often struggled with SVG implementations, so decided to go that route this time. It is slower than the canvas animation updates, but it has a nice set of functions that'll be useful elsewhere.
